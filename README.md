# Kid friendly Sonos Controller

- Allows to configure which groups of speakers to control
- Searches all available services and removes duplicates (perhaps restrict if not possible)
- Search for artist
- Displays albums
- Plays albums automatically and stops current playback => only pause, next and volume control is available
- Max limit for volume

## ToDo
- Create config for speaker / groups
- Add tiles incl. icons to display
- Add handler for local storage => npm?!

## Ideas
- Change tabs for breadcrumb incl. image of artist and album
- or: deactivate forward jumps on missing data in tab navigation
