# Kid friendly Sonos Controller

- Allows to configure which groups of speakers to control
- Searches all available services and removes duplicates (perhaps restrict if not possible)
- Search for artist
- Displays albums
- Plays albums automatically and stops current playback => only pause, next and volume control is available
- Max limit for volume

## ToDo
- Fix issues from Viktor
- add ESLint
- validate if parameters are there: check speaker groups always
- deactivate forward jumps on missing data in tab navigation
- change to viktor's folder structure
- use speaker groups hook
- Add tiles incl. icons to display (icon big centered, font below)
- Add handler for local storage => npm?! => hook!!!
